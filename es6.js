//Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
/*
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.

var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
As you can see in the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James and then overridden to be David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite.

Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.

If you were to replace var with let in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.

let camper = 'James';
let camper = 'David'; // throws an error
This error can be seen in the console of your browser.

So unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. For instance:

"use strict";
x = 3.14; // throws an error because x is not declared

Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.
*/

let catName;
let quote;

function catTalk() {
    "use strict";

    catName = "Oliver";
    quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();


// Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
function checkScope() {
    "use strict";
    let i = "function scope";
    if (true) {
        let i = "block scope";
        console.log("Block scope i is: ", i);
    }
    console.log("Function scope i is: ", i);
    return i;
}

//Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
/*
let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.

"use strict"
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error

As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.


Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

function printManyTimes(str) {
    "use strict";

    // change code below this line

    const SENTENCE = str + " is cool!";
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += 2) {
        console.log(SENTENCE);
    }

    // change code above this line

}
printManyTimes("freeCodeCamp");

// Mutate an Array Declared with const

/*

The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]

As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.


An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignment.
*/
const s = [5, 7, 2];

function editInPlace() {
    "use strict";
    // change code below this line

    // s = [2, 5, 7]; <- this is invalid
    s[0] = 2;
    s[1] = 5;
    s[2] = 7;
    // change code above this line
}
editInPlace();

// Prevent Object Mutation
// Object.freeze
/*
As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.
*/

let obj = {
    name: "FreeCodeCamp",
    review: "Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj);
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}

//In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties .

function freezeObj() {
    "use strict";
    const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
        PI: 3.14
    };
    // change code below this line
    Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

    // change code above this line
    try {
        MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
    } catch (ex) {
        console.log(ex);
    }
    return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();

//Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

/*
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:

const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:

const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

const myFunc= () => "value"
This code will still return value by default.


Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.
*/

const magic = () => {
    "use strict";
    return new Date();
};

// OR

const magic = () => new Date();

// Write Arrow Functions with Parameters
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => {
    "use strict";
    return arr1.concat(arr2);
};
// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));

// OR

const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));



// Write Higher Order Arrow Functions

/*
It's time we see how powerful arrow functions are when processing data.

Arrow functions work really well with higher order functions, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), that take other functions as arguments for processing collections of data.

Read the following code:

FBPosts.filter(function(post) {
  return post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500;
})
We have written this with filter() to at least make it somewhat readable. Now compare it to the following code which uses arrow function syntax instead:

FBPosts.filter((post) => post.thumbnail !== null && post.shares > 100 && post.likes > 500)
This code is more succinct and accomplishes the same task with fewer lines of code.


Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (fractions are not integers) in the array realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.
*/

const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34];
const squareList = (arr) => {
    "use strict";
    // change code below this line
    const squaredIntegers = arr.filter((element) => (Number.isInteger(element) && element > 0)).map((num => num * num));

    // change code above this line
    return squaredIntegers;
};
// test your code
const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
